If more water is needed in certain parts of the pan, add boiling water sparingly, sprinkling from a large spoon. If too much water is in the rice, lay newspaper lightly over the top of it and it will absorb excess water.Best served right out of the pan. In Spain, eating with the men out in the fields, the mussel shells served as spoons.","Serve with crusty bread and a tossed salad. I recommend violating the seafood-white wine rule; this meal goes best with a hardy red of your choice.This recipe yields 6 servings.Comments: I suggest the first time you do a paella that you stick close to the recipe. After that, feel free to experiment to taste. I also suggest you do not attempt a paella for two. This is a meal that requires a great deal of loving work to prepare, more than you would feel inclined to spend for only two persons. It requires close attention for quite a few hours. It cannot be hurried. I have tried to calculate the quantities required for six adults. There will be leftovers - there almost always are.The first thing you need is a proper paella pan. You will find paella pans of many sizes and shapes. The best will be the most shallow and broad you can find, with its rim slanted outward. No lid needed. I have a paella pan that serves 8 persons; it is about 13 inches across at the top, 11 inches across the bottom, and the sides are only about an inch and a half high. It feeds eight persons comfortably. (I also have one that serves 16!)The best way to clean and treat the pan: rub its insides vigorously with a wedge of lemon after each use (and before first use), rinse, dry, and wipe its insides with olive oil on a paper towel. It should remain rust free and ready for use."],"ingredients":[{"name":"bay leaf","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"bell pepper","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"calamari","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"canned peas","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"fresh parsley","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"garlic","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"garlic","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"green beans","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"green bell pepper","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"meat","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"mussels","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"olive oil","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"onion","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"roma tomatoes","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"saffron","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"shrimp","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"white rice","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"}]},{"name":"Banana Chocolate Chip Cookies With Flax","description":" ","cookTime":45.0,"instructions":["Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).","Place parchment paper on cookie sheets.

The good news is that it is easy  to make your favorites at home, using less sodium and more fresh or frozen produce.In about the time it takes to order and pick up Chinese, you can make a healthier version of cashew chicken with this simple, throw it all in the crockpot recipe.  I think if I were to make this again I would roast the cashews to crisp them up and add them before serving rather than cooking them alongside the chicken.   I used frozen broccoli but fresh would be fine too.I served with a green salad but my Better-than-Takeout Chicken Fried Rice would be a great side, just leave out the chicken.What to do:layer chicken, cashews and vegetables in the crockpotcombine remaining ingredients except water and pour over chicken in crockpotadd water or broth if necessary so mixture is almost completely coveredcook for 2-4 hours on high or 4-8 hours on low"],"ingredients":[{"name":"broccoli","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"brown sugar","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"carrots","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"cashews","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"chicken breasts","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"chicken broth","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"garlic clove","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"ginger paste","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"ketchup","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"olive oil","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"red pepper flakes","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"rice wine vinegar","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"salt and pepper","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"},{"name":"soy sauce","count":1.0,"cooktime":1.0,"dietType":"None"}]},{"name":"Balsamic Roasted Vegetables","description":" ","cookTime":45.0,"instructions":["Clean and top the beets and, along with the fingerling potatoes, drizzle with enough olive oil just to coat.

I cook this until the onion softens about 4 minutes.Then I add my orange juice and the juice from 12 a lime, which I stir in well.   I bring them just to a boil before I add my chicken stock, which covers about 3/4 of my meat.  I set the heat to medium, and bring this to a slow simmer to braise for the next three hours.I fried taco shells by adding a few inches of vegetable oil to a deep fry pan and set it to high heat.  When sizzling, using tongs, I floated 1/2 of a 10 corn tortilla on the surface of the blistering oil  about 5 seconds did the trick, or until it set.Moving quickly but carefully, I flipped the tortilla over, rolling it in the oil, releasing the tongs from one edge and immediately catching the other edge in their grip.Holding the other edge under the hot oil, I fried it until crunchy, then dipped the center fold into the pot to crisp it up last.   Be careful to pour all the oil out when lifting your shells from the fryer.  I sprinkled them with sea salt while hotI put my small deep pan, with a few glugs of EVOO, over the heat for about 10 minutes before adding 1/2 a cup of my diced onion and some minced garlic.  I cook this until just softened and fragrant.  Then I add about a teaspoon of black pepper, a healthy sprinkling of cumin, and a dash of sea salt.  Finally, I add my can of pinto beans, liquid and all.  I cover and bring to a simmer, heating all the beans through.I peel, mash and add fresh cilantro, a dash of minced garlic, a squeeze of lemon juice, sea salt, cracked black pepper, 1/2 of the rest of my diced red onion, and ground cumin to my avocados to make gaucamole.In another bowl, Ive mixed my diced tomatoes, some diced red onion, minced garlic, fresh cilantro, the juice of 1/2 a lime, a glug of EVOO, and a dash of white vinegar together (along with some diced jalapeno, if you want heat), to make a quick fresh delicious pico de gallo.My carnitas are perfect: their edges are caramelized and crunchy, their interiors tender and falling apart at the tiniest touch of a fork.  I scoop about 4 tablespoons of that uber-rich pork/citrus/chicken/EVOOfat up and dump it into my beans for flavor.After about 15 minutes, and some squishing of beans with my fork, they are thick and syrupy and ready for another shot of pepper and some fresh cilantro.  If you like things hot, some jalapeno could be added to this mix, or a dash or two of hot pepper oil.Finally, as the sun sets in the west, my tacos are ready to be eaten.  We each make our own: mine has an underlayer of soft shredded cheese, a heaping helping of tender, citrus-spiced pork, some pico, some guacamole, some sour cream and a sprinkling of cilantro on top, along with some cheese and cream on my beans, too.Each delightful bite is a mouthful of fresh, heady flavors, bright with herbs and orange/lime, deep with cumin and pepper spice.

Although the recipe called for clarified  butter, I couldnt help but dig into this lusciousness; it was, metaphorically speaking, burning a hole in my fridge.","Using a butter knife, I spread about a tablespoon of this fantastic fat along the top and sides (sliding in between the leaves  and even shoving underneath) of my stacked, toppled, and loosely packed together tower of slender potato slices.  I sprinkle generously with salt and pepper, and place into a 400 degree oven to roast for 40 minutes.","I melt the remaining tablespoon of duck fat in my wok over medium high heat to sizzling","Before I add my minced onion, which I let soften and translusce","Before I add my mushrooms, which Ive scrubbed clean, and which I let brown","Before I add my red wine, which I let simmer and reduce for a few minutes","Before I add my beef stock, which I bring to a boil.","And I let it boil, and boil, and boil  for the entire 40 minutes that my potatoes are cooking, which reduces and releases all the stocks extraneous liquids into my kitchens atmosphere, while concentrating the flavors of beef, wine, and mushroom.  Here I am at the 20 minute mark; one can see how far down the wok the sauce has simmered  about 50%.","I was willing to pay $30 for Wagyu steaks tonight, but Savenors only had two cuts available: ribeyes, which were upwards of $50/lb (too rich for my purse), and sirloin tips for a very reasonable $14.99/lb  which is less then what I pay for dry-aged steaks from Whole Foods.  I usually equate sirloin tips with Golden Corral, though, and Ive never really worked with them  plus, I certainly didnt know how to work with them on my crappy electric stovetop.  Most recipes I immediately encountered suggested marinating sirloin tips in burgandy, but I simply couldnt imagine adulterating the fragile flavor perfection of such an excellent quality cow by drowning it in wine.  But the beauty of Waygu is its tenderness  their Japanese progenitors are massaged by hand, and nipple-fed beer, for crying out loud, and our American cross-breeds are better-eating vegans than Gwenyth","See how marbled?  These threads of fat will turn to aspic under the searing heat, leaving tender sinews the beg to burst under the pressure of piercing, tearing canines.","I need to buy some grapeseed oil, which is what I prefer when searing meat.  Olive oil smokes to quickly, and its flavor does heat well, IMHO.  So I used a 60/40-ish hand blend of vegetable oil and sesame oil  providing a high-smoking point and a gentle, toasty flavor.  Ive cut my sirloin tips into large cubes, and I now throw those big ol bites into my sizzling oil.","Action Shot! (Ok, crappy shot  just work with me here) Using tongs, and a little patience, I  cook each cube for about 1 minute on each side: thats top, bottom, and each of its four (or so) sides.  With the heat set to high, this imparts a quick caramelization on each surface, trapping in the sweet sweet juices, encrusting the edges with crisp flavor, and evenly cooking the insides to leave a cool, pink, supple center.","Its now 40 minutes, and my mushroom wine stock has reduced to a rich, thick jus.","Using my smallest bowl, I scoop about a tablespoon of cornstarch out of the bin, and mix it  using a pastry brush to smoothen it  with a few tablespoons of my hot gravy stock.","I dribble and blend this thickening mixture into my sauce, setting the heat on low and stirring well.  This will tun my thin, savory jus into a thick, rich gravy.","At the final moment, I pull my potatoes out of the oven.  They are crisp at the edges, and sizzling underneath.

I made a few changes to the recipe; I added more chocolate and instead of three cups of milk, I used 1 and 1/2 cups of milk and 1 and 1/2 cups of coffee to give the pudding a slight mocha taste.  I also left out the dark rum and doubled up on the vanilla extract.  If you want to add in rum use 1 tablespoon dark rum and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  I skipped the step to strain the pudding through a sieve into a medium bowl and I found that the pudding was perfectly smooth.
